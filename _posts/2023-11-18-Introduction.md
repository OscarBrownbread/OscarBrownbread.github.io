Hey, Brian here. Welcome to my website! This introductory post is the place to start. You can find my [**CV**](https://oscarbrownbread.github.io/about/), [**GitHub projects**](https://github.com/OscarBrownbread), publications, etc.

- My PhD thesis is titled _Photocatalysis with Carbon Nitrides for Hydrogen Evolution_ and is available for download [**here**](https://edoc.ub.uni-muenchen.de/21034/).

- My research on OLEDs was published as a book, and a preview is available on [**Google Books**](https://books.google.de/books/about/Porphyrin_Materials_for_Organic_Light_Em.html?id=vX9kD9FFg9sC).

- Cartography – I love spatial data. My OpenStreetMap.org profile is available [**here**](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/OscarBrownbread).
