# Personal
I'm a highly educated, international, and dedicated scientist with broad-ranging skills in physics, chemistry, and nanotechnology.
I have an excellent education with top grades from distinguished institutions such as Trinity College Dublin (The University of
Dublin), Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, and the Max-Planck-Institut fur Festkörperforschung. I
hold a doctorate degree in inorganic chemistry and a Master’s degree in physics.

My research projects include phosphorescent organic LEDs, the hydrogen-evolution reaction with carbon nitride photocatalysts, and superhydrophobic surfaces.
