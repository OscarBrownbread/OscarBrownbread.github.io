# Overview
I'm a highly educated, international, and dedicated scientist with broad-ranging skills in physics, chemistry, and nanotechnology.
I have an excellent education with top grades from distinguished institutions such as Trinity College Dublin (The University of
Dublin), Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, and the Max-Planck-Institut fur Festkörperforschung. I
hold a doctorate degree in inorganic chemistry and a Master’s degree in physics.

My research projects include phosphorescent organic LEDs, the hydrogen-evolution reaction with carbon nitride photocatalysts, and superhydrophobic surfaces.

## Education
06/2016–08/2016
:    **Postdoctoral research with Prof. Bettina Lotsch, Nanochemistry group, Stuttgart**

- Dr. rer. nat. (PhD)

04/2012 - 05/2016
:    **PhD continued with Prof. Bettina Lotsch, Nanochemistry group at the Max
Planck Institute for Solid State Research (MPI-FKF), Stuttgart, Germany**

10/2010 - 04/2012
:    **PhD doctoral studies with Prof. Bettina Lotsch, Inorganic Chemistry group at
Ludwig-Maximilian-Universit¨at (LMU), Munich, Germany**

Thesis topic
:    **Photocatalysis with carbon nitrides for hydrogen evolution from water**
What I did
:    Designed and setup the photocatalysis lab and investigated photoactive powders
with low-cost synthesis. I developed these catalysts to split water using light.

Grade
:    magna cum laude

- Master of Science in Physics (M.Sc.)

10/2008 - 10/2010
:    **Master’s studies with Prof. Werner Blau, Molecular Electronics group at Trinity
College Dublin (TCD), University of Dublin, Ireland**

Thesis topic
:    Phosphorescent materials for organic light emitting diodes

What I did
:    Developed an organic-LED device with a technique that triples the light efficiency.
Grade: Pass (pass/fail grading only)

• Bachelor of Science in Applied Physics (B.Sc.)

10/2004 - 10/2008
:    **Bachelor thesis at Dublin City University (DCU)**

Thesis topic
:    Superhydrophobic surfaces by simple production methods

Grade
: first class honours
