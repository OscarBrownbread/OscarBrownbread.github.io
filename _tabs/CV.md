# Overview
I'm a highly educated, international, and dedicated scientist with broad-ranging skills in physics, chemistry, and nanotechnology.
I have an excellent education with top grades from distinguished institutions such as Trinity College Dublin (The University of
Dublin), Ludwig-Maximilians-Universität, and the Max-Planck-Institut fur Festkörperforschung. I
hold a doctorate degree in inorganic chemistry and a Master’s degree in physics. I'm currently working as a language copyeditor at Copernicus Publications.

My research projects include phosphorescent organic LEDs, the hydrogen-evolution reaction with carbon nitride photocatalysts, and superhydrophobic surfaces.

- **Doctoral degree Dr. rer. nat. (PhD)**
  - Thesis topic: _Photocatalysis with carbon nitrides for hydrogen evolution from water_
  - What I did: Designed and set up the photocatalysis lab and investigated CN photocatalysts.
    I developed these catalysts for the hydrogen-evolution reaction with solar simulators.
  - Grade: _magna cum laude_
